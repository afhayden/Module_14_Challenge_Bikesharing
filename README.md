## Summary
It seems that there are way more male riders than there are female. Most people subscribe to the Rider program. Males and females use the bikes at similar times through the week and day, there is just a lot more males users.

## Two (2) Additional Visualization Recommendations
* Display a map of riders by age on a geographical map - perhaps specific bikes that are easier to handle could be placed in areas that are more populated by the elderly to ensourage usage.
* Bar Chart - Provide a breakout of users by age to determine the best type of marketing or social media avenue to take.
